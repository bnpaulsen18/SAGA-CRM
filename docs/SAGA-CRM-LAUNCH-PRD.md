## APPENDIX

### A. Pricing Strategy

**Free Trial:** 14 days, no credit card required
**Pricing Tier:** Single plan — no tiers

**SAGA: $100/month + a 2% platform fee**
- $100/month subscription
- 2% platform fee on donations processed through SAGA (a Stripe Connect application fee — Stripe's own processing fees are separate)
- Unlimited contacts
- Unlimited donations
- Unlimited users
- Unlimited campaigns
- AI-powered thank-you messages
- Email receipts
- PDF receipts
- Reports & analytics
- Email support
- All future features included

**Why $100 + 2%?**
- Priced at parity with mainstream nonprofit CRMs rather than as the budget option — SAGA competes on the AI agents, not on being the cheapest
- The 2% aligns SAGA's revenue with the customer's outcome: SAGA earns more only when the organization raises more
- A flat subscription keeps the base cost predictable — no per-seat or per-contact metering
- Donations settle directly into the organization's own Stripe account; SAGA never holds the funds

> **This price point is negotiable.** $100 + 2% is positioned *relative to competing platforms*, and is expected to move as that landscape shifts or as specific partnerships warrant. What is fixed is the **shape** of the model — one plan, a flat subscription plus a percentage of donations processed. Any change to the numbers lands in **[README.md](../README.md)** first; treat that file as canonical over this appendix.

### B. Competitor Analysis

| Feature | SAGA CRM | Bloomerang | DonorPerfect | Kindful |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Price** | $100/mo + 2% | $99/mo | $150/mo | $100/mo |
| **AI Thank-Yous** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **AI Insights** | ✅ | Limited | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Modern UI** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| **Ease of Use** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| **Setup Time** | <15 min | 1-2 hours | 3-4 hours | 1-2 hours |
| **Email Automation** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Reporting** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Mobile App** | ❌ (Post-MVP) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| **Integrations** | Limited | Many | Many | Many |

> Competitor pricing above is **December 2025 desk research** and has not been re-verified since. Verify current list prices before using this table in any external or investor-facing material.

**SAGA's Competitive Advantages:**
1. AI-first (unique positioning)
2. Modern, beautiful UI
3. Fastest setup (<15 min vs. 1-4 hours)
4. Priced at market parity, with the 2% fee tying SAGA's revenue to the organization's fundraising results
5. Built for 2025+ (not legacy software)

> **Note on positioning:** SAGA is *not* the cheapest option at $100/mo + 2% — it sits at roughly the same list price as Kindful and slightly above Bloomerang. The differentiation is the four AI agents and time-to-value, not price. Earlier drafts of this PRD claimed "most affordable" against a $49 price point; that claim was retired along with that price.

### C. Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Email Deliverability**
- Mitigation: Use Resend (high deliverability), authenticate domain (SPF/DKIM), monitor bounce rates, provide alternative "view online" link

**Risk 2: AI Generation Failures**
- Mitigation: Always provide fallback messages, cache generated content, monitor API uptime, set budget limits

**Risk 3: Low User Adoption**
- Mitigation: Invest in onboarding (wizard, checklist), provide sample data, offer 1-on-1 setup calls, create video tutorials

**Risk 4: Competition from Established Players**
- Mitigation: Emphasize AI differentiation, target underserved small nonprofits, build community, iterate faster than incumbents

**Risk 5: Regulatory Compliance Issues**
- Mitigation: Consult CPA on tax receipt requirements, implement GDPR features, obtain legal review of Terms/Privacy, stay updated on nonprofit regulations

### D. Success Stories (Hypothetical for Now)

**Green Valley Community Center**
- Imported 800 contacts in 10 minutes
- Recorded 250 donations in first month
- Saved 10 hours/week on admin tasks
- Increased donor retention from 45% to 62%
- Quote: "SAGA's AI thank-you messages feel so personal. Our donors love them!"

**Animal Rescue Network**
- Launched year-end campaign with $75k goal
- Raised $82k (109% of goal)
- AI insights identified 15 major gift prospects
- Converted 3 prospects to $5k+ gifts
- Quote: "The AI showed us exactly who to ask. We wouldn't have found these donors otherwise."
